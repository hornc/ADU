# 𐘇𐘬 (A-DU)

A-DU is a thematic programming language based on Linear A balance ledger tablets.
A-DU (𐘇𐘬) means something like Assessment in Linear A.
Most of the meanings and structure and inspiration for the Linear A aspect of this language comes from the work and resources provided online by John G. Younger. A huge thank you to him and his work.

This is an archive of a proof-of-concept interpreter and some examples I wrote for this idea in 2018. It may or may not be complete.
